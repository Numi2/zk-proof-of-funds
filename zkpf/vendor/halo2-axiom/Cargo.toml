description = '''
Fast PLONK-based zero-knowledge proving system.
This is a fork of <https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2>, which is itself a fork of ZCash's "halo2_proofs" crate.
This fork uses the KZG polynomial commitment scheme for the proving backend, which requires a one-time universal trusted setup.
Publishing this crate for better versioning in Axiom's production usage.

This crate requires rust nightly to build.
