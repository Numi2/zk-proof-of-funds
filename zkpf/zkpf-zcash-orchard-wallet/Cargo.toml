# Zcash light client stack used for the Orchard wallet backend.
# These versions are chosen to match the upstream `librustzcash` workspace that
# `zcash_client_sqlite` depends on (0.19.0 / 0.21.0 / 0.7.1, etc.).
#
# Features:
# - `orchard` enables Orchard note support.
# - `sync` + `lightwalletd-tonic-transport` enable the async lightwalletd sync pipeline.
